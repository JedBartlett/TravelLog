(Jerusalem) is equally important
for all religions and for all nationalities,
and this is why Jerusalem is considered to
be the spiritual capital of the whole world,
and I'm saying this because I do know the eyes of the whole world are focusing
here in Jerusalem.

Why? because Jerusalem is so sacred and political,
with a sacred history.
There are two kinds of history.
One is the history made by humans, the supposed
profane history, and then there is the sacred history,
the history of Salvation,
the history that began at mount Sinai because of Moses
and culminated in here with both
the divine incarnation of the divine Logos,
what is said of our Lord Jesus Christ in Bethlehem
and His passion and crucifixion in here,
in Jerusalem, and here of course, his resurrection.

And what has made Jerusalem to be unique and so important for everybody
is the fact that this part of the earth is unique, privileged to have been
blessed in sacrifice by the very human God that Paul has described.

And not only this, I want you to bear in mind
that this part of the earth hosted in her bosom
the very body of our Lord Jesus Christ.

That is to say he was buried here,
He was resurrected here.
And this is what makes Jerusalem to be a unique place,
and to be the sacred city for the whole world.

And today, the conflict here, after all, is
a conflict over the sanctity of Jerusalem;
and the Patriarchate of Jerusalem is the embodiment of the history here and the
embodiment of Jerusalem.

Why? because the Patriarchate of Jerusalem,
the Temple of Jerusalem,
is the Holy Church that has been built upon it over the foundations of the blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
And it is from here that the Church was expanded all over the world.
This is why the Jerusalem church is the mother of all the churches.

And, it is true,
that the only church that really remains unshakable
and keeps unchanged the apostolic tradition,
sound and clear, is the church of Jerusalem.
Why?
because this is the only church that is the Church of the liturgy,
is the Church of prayer.

The protestants and the Catholics,
and many others,
they say that the Orthodox Church,
spends all their time in prayers,
just prayers and prayers.
But, we are proud of it,
and take pride in it.
Why? because the foundation the importance of the Church is the divine liturgy,
the sacrament of the divine Eucharist.

Because it is in there, when we participate
in and partake of the divine Eucharist
of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that we make clear that the body,
that the Church, is not an institution;
is not an organization, like many others,
a charitable organization;
because the ultimate purpose of the Church is not charity,
is not anything else.
The ultimate purpose of the Church
is to make us worthy to attain to the vision
not with the physical eyes, the physical side,
but more importantly,
with contemplation and the eyes of the soul to attain to
the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glory
that was manifested as the uncreated light
on the day of our Lord's transfiguration on Mount Tabor.
Where there, His disciples were present,
they have this unique experience,
and the light that was manifested on Mount Tabor
on the day of our Lord's transfiguration
It is our salvation,
it is what we call in very simple words the paradise,
this is the eternal life.

The ultimate purpose of the Church,
of the Orthodox Church,
is to make us worthy to join the human nature of our Lord Jesus Christ
because He was resurrected not for His own sake.
Our Lord Jesus Christ was the Master of life and death,
so His resurrection concerns our own resurrection.
That is to say the humanity, our own humanity,
that He has given to us, He made His own,
and delivered from all sorts of sicknesses,
delivered from the bondage of corruption.

Now, this is why Jerusalem is very important.
Why? because here the holy places are not
just mere stones.
The protestants say it doesn't matter,
you don't need merely stones we need the living stones.
But those people,
they fail to understand that the earth itself the holy places
are not just historical monuments
but are the living and undeniable testimony
and witness to the sacred history.
That is to say, to our dead, and our crucified
and risen Lord Jesus Christ.

The holy places remain for the disciples
of Christ, as they were during our Lord's earthly life.
Most of these pilgrims have the opportunity,
in many cases, to see, with their physical eyes
and to understand with their spiritual eyes,
both the humanity and the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ.

And today, we have the same opportunity.
Why? because our Lord Jesus Christ is both invisible is intangible,
and at the same time visible and tangible.
How? it is given through His own church, and
the Church is the body of Christ,
not just the bride of Christ, as Saint Paul says.
But also, Christ Himself is the head of His
body, He is the head of the Church.
I always emphasis this because protestants
say that the Church is the body of Christ only.
And the thing is, that the Church is
Christ present in our history.
Christ who is extending to the ages of ages.

And the way to understand Christ is to understand that he is invisible,
but at the same visible, is untouchable and yet touchable
as when we see the Church as the sacrament of the divine Eucharist.
It is in and through the divine Eucharist that we realize that the Church
is not an organization that promotes moral values.
It is not enough to be just "Good", that doesn't mean anything.
Puritanism and moralism have nothing to do
with the Orthodox concept of the Church.

For us, the Church, Christ, is the reality,
and is part and parcel of our presence here.
These holy places are the prototype,
are evidence that the way of salvation is in and through Christ.
We must do more than give good sermons
and presenting the Church in the moralistic way.
Those things are a total illusion.
You have to be very careful because otherwise,
if we understand Christian values and the Bible,
and the mystery of the incarnation the way
the protestants understand it,
then we will precipitate a total disaster because there,
and in other religions, you have moral values
and moral taboos.
But, you should not understand the Church in this way.


The church of Jerusalem
has this belief, this mission, this unique power.
Why? because here, in this holy land,
especially in Jerusalem the atmosphere is totally theocratic.
I don't mean it in a negative way, but it is the truth.

Everybody who is here and everybody who debates here has claims,
religious claims.
And in the reason that all these nationalities, national entities,
and communities are here, or want to be here,
is for religious reasons and not anything else.
Because the Holy Land and Jerusalem don't promote financial or military or
other such interests.
So, the mission of the Patriarchate and of the Orthodox Church here,
is to be the only church, or religious and Christian institution that,
throughout the ages, that maintains its focus on our one mission,
and the mission is spiritual and religious.
Thanks to the Patriarchate here that most of the holy places have been protected
and guarded, and have otherwise survived.
Otherwise, most of all of them would have been vanished and destroyed,
as has happened to some of them.

And what is characteristic of the brotherhood
here of the Holy Tomb\footnote{
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre}{
    Orthodox monastic fraternity - the brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre}
  }?
It is as it has been throughout the ages, for almost two
thousand years, to sustain the church, the holy places
as places of worship.
And this is True! because day and night in almost all holy places,
you have services.
If you go to the Holy Sepulcher, day and night there are all the services,
and especially the Divine Liturgy.
The same applies to the church of the nativity,
the same applies to the tomb of the Virgin Mary,
the same in Nazareth and in many other places.

We welcome pilgrims like Christ welcomed the apostle Thomas
Everybody knows that St. Thomas was so eager To see with his physical eyes,
and to touch with his physical senses, the very body of Christ,
in order to make clear to himself that Christ is God and He is Lord.
Now, you are here are like the apostle Thomas.
Why? because you've been given this blessing, this opportunity,
to come and see and experience with your own physical eyes
and to touch with your own hands all those holy places that bear witness
to the sacred history,
to the life of both the old testament, the personalities of the old testament,
the prophets, and also to the personalities, and to the life,
and to the preaching and miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ here in the Holy Land.
This is why your pilgrimage here differs from any other pilgrimage to any other
place of the world.

The prophet David says that the earth belongs to God,
and therefore, whatever the earth contains is perfect, is complete.
And it is true, that the whole creation,
which is the creation of God is holy and perfect.
But here in the Holy Land there is something very special.
This specific part of the earth is associated with the divine,
with the mystery of the divine economia, the mystery of the dispensation,
the mystery of salvation.

And this is why your pilgrimage here,
in the land of the church of Jerusalem,
is called a pilgrimage of theoria.
Theoria is a greek word -- theory;
but theoria in the language of the church fathers means two things:
The first is theoria through the physical eyes, visions;
and the other is theoria of the spiritual eyes; this is contemplation.
People here are given the opportunity
to join into the life of our Lord Jesus Christ,
His preaching, His miracles, His passion,
His crucifixion, His resurrection, His baptism, His ascension;
This is why it is called a pilgrimage of theoria.

What is the power of the church of Jerusalem?
We've seen that It is the only place where
pilgrims from around the world, of all Orthodox nationalities and countries,
come and get together,
and every time we receive pilgrims from around the Orthodox world,
we demonstrate and actually celebrate our own Pentecost.
And we demonstrate our unity and our oneness
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
And baptize unity.
And this one is by no means reduces or minimizes our special, natural,
linguistic, national, or other identities;
above all, our biological identity.

I have to emphasize this because you come from certain countries and
unfortunately today people must be very careful because the modern world is not
model world.
It is something very sad, and very bad.
Because what globalization promotes today,
and people do not understand because they are very much misled,
the so-called ``globalization'' is the language of the evil powers,
is the language of the devil.
Now, globalization (as we understand it) has already come.
We understand globalization in terms of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He is the new creation, He is the new age, He is everything new.
He is the uniter.
In Christ we have our own globalization;
because in Christ, our humanity, our common humanity is manifested.
He assumed common humanity, not the humanity of St. George and Peter and Paul,
He assumed common humanity; which means, potentially speaking,
everybody is inclined unto salvation.

But today's globalization is very misleading.
Why? because there is one target of globalization.
And the target is the Orthodox Church.
Why the Orthodox Church?
because the Orthodox Church is the only church that strongly guards
the apostolic tradition,
and the only church that holds steadfastly
to the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.
And Christ Himself spoke of His own identity, and His own name,
and therefore of our own identity.
Each one of us has his own name, his own identity, he is unique, he is a person.
Everybody has been made after the image and likeness of God, and therefore,
identity is very important;
and the objective of globalization today is to destroy identity.

This is why you hear the spokesman for European union,
and people from your own countries,
promote the so called "liberal values".
This is extremely dangerous and very misleading.
Liberal values, liberal democracies, are very much against,
the dignity and the uniqueness of the human being,
of the likeness and image of our God.
And therefore, this is what Jerusalem stands against,
everywhere, even outside the Holy Land,
everyone speaks about globalization,
the only place that globalization has no place is here in Jerusalem.
Why? because the people here, the nationalities
here, the nations, they are religious entities.

Don't believe the politician, don't believe anyone.
Here, if you don't have religious affiliation,
you have no existence.
And this is why everybody's eyes are on Jerusalem.
And the Patriarchate, our church, the Orthodox Church
is one, and unique.
And those of us here, we don't represent ourselves,
we represent the whole world, the whole Christendom, and more specifically,
we represent our Orthodox brothers and sisters.

And here, the Orthodox Patriarchate is the only church
that keeps and guards, not only the holy places,
but keeps and guards the Christian character of the Holy Land,
and especially of the holy city of Jerusalem.
And when I say the holy city of Jerusalem,
I mean the Holy City.  (The city that has been made Holy)
If it wasn't for the Patriarchate, today,
the Christian character of Jerusalem would have been totally altered,
and disappeared.
And we are here, but our presence here is a daily miracle.

So, I wish you a blessed, happy stay and a blessed pilgrimage.
and please, when you go back home, try to become messengers;
and convey and communicate to your own countrymen, your relatives,
what you have experienced, what you have seen, what you have heard.
That your own countrymen,
the young generation would be encouraged to have their own pilgrimage here.
And I desire this for only for one reason:
in order to strengthen and make people understand
that the Church is in the holy place,
that guarantees our activity, our faith, our identity.

Welcome and God bless you.

\emph{Fr. Gregory --}
Thank you Sayedna.
Sayedna, one brief question, for our pilgrims
while they're here,

perhaps you could tell them how to prepare their hearts now to see all the holy
places and to be with Christ.
Just the interior spirit to help them bring
this message back home. The best way.

\emph{His Eminence --}
To be here and to not just see the holy places but to take a part in and to
participate in the divine liturgies,
the divine Eucharist that is taking place,
both in the holy sepulcher and in the holy places.
