# TravelLog
Just a place to store my private notes and journal experiences.

## How To Contribute
The root document is TravelLogIstrael.tex,
which is a LaTeX document that can be compiled to produce a publication-ready PDF.

For more information about TeX and LaTeX, see this url:

In order to download and compile this document to help contribute,
you'll want to do 2 things:

 1. Get yourself setup in Git (version control system)
   - You'll want to get started by installing the GitHub Desktop client
     and ensuring you can authenticate
     https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/

   - Then you'll want to clone down the repository so you have a local copy
     of the project to work on.

   - You might want to run through a walkthrough of Git if you want to actually
     contribute back,
     I request that you use a pull-request if you want to make any edits at all.

     A good walkthrough can be found here:
     https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

 2. Install the TeX editor
   - There are LaTeX editors and compiler toolchains for every platform
     (windows, mac, linux).

   - For windows, stick with the proTeX package,
     it bundles MikeTeX (the compiler and package manager)
     and TeXStudio (the editor)
